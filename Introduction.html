								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>My name is Andy and I am a recent high school graduate, born and raised in the western suburbs of Melbourne. My parents are from Vietnam and fled from the Vietnam war and came to Australia to start a new life. I can speak 2 languages, Vietnamese and English but I am also trying to learn Japanese in my own time. My current hobbies currently include playing video games, playing badminton and just hanging out with friends. I use to play volleyball in high school but always fell short of first place at the interschool's tournaments.

								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p>I started my interest in IT when I helped build my first computer with my older brother. I was really interested in computer parts. Currently, I have two interests in the IT field, software engineering and cybersecurity. My interests in cybersecurity come from when I was younger I would watch youtube videos on cyber-attacks/hacking groups that would happen around the world. For example, the cicada 3301 consisted of puzzles in which individuals had to decrypt a message. On the other hand, programming has always piqued my interest, I have always tried to learn python on my own but did not have the discipline and commitment to complete it during high school. I also understand that if I go down this route, I will have to always be up to date with the latest news for the IT field due to the everchanging improvement of technology.
