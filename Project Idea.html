								<h1>Badminton Project Idea</h1>
								<p>As I am currently a beginner in badminton, I strive to develop technique quickly and therefore will require some form of training or guidance. Playing Badminton without knowing how to do certain techniques will only get you so far. Therefore, learning the fundamentals of the game is very important. Badminton is a sport that is very big in Asian countries compared to Australia and therefore there will be a catchup/lack of coaches that can provide quality teaching to people who want to learn the game. As a result of this, using an application that has all badminton related videos in one place will allow users to find what they are looking for easily.
								</p>
								<p>Users of the application will have to first log in to comment or post anything on the application, and if they don’t they will just be able to view the pages. The application home page will act like a forums page for users to submit any questions/videos to the community, this allows for users to get different types of feedback they can use. Other members of the community will be able to comment with videos of what a technique should look like, allowing for the user to visually see and learn how it is done. If the user wants to look up certain techniques, the website will take them to a page with a list of videos that will allow the user to preview them or search for the video that they need. Each technique should display the name of the technique underneath the video so that users are able to efficiently search for the techniques they need. Subtitles detailing a list of instructions should also be provided in the videos to allow for people who cannot hear to read the techniques to accommodate them.
								</p>
								<p>If possible, AI technology can be used to analyse users’ videos and pinpoint flaws in their techniques that they can improve on. This would require the application to recognise the person in the video and the racquet. The person will use their phones to record their video which has to be placed in a way that the video can see the whole body of the user. After that, the AI has to be able to analyse the user's form and provide the right sample video/feedback to the user. The user can also request the application to send it to a coach who will also be able to provide feedback to the user. AI technology is on the rise therefore utilising it will be a way to differentiate the application from other badminton competitors' services. The users can also pay a premium service to allow the AI bot to learn the patterns of the user by setting a camera that views them and the court. The AI has to recognise the court and the shuttlecock to see where the shuttlecock is often hit or how the user moves relative to the court.
								</p>
								<p>By contacting badminton businesses the application can recommend its community members to buy from supported business partners. This also allows business owners to promote their brand while also improving their recognition and reputation. Even though the business will also have to pay a fee to be shown, they will also have a list of benefits which include digital advertising, discount codes and links to their brand.
								</p>
								<p>The application will have to be able to be used on the internet while also being made into a mobile application. Therefore the developers would need to know how to make a website to create the forums page. After that, there will be a need for mobile app creation so that people are able to download the application down into their phones. A server room will also be needed to store the data of users and their videos and posts. The management of the application will also need to get into contact with businesses to help build a wider community and bring new customers. Allowing businesses and the community to develop a better connection for quality badminton equipment.
								</p>
								<p>The skills required for the projects are for developers to know HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a website. To create the mobile application, developers would need to know how to use java or python. These skills are very feasible to find, with the current job market. There is an increased demand in the IT field every year. Developers will also need to know how to store data into a database so that the server room can be kept up to date. Also, engineers to code the AI part of the application will be needed. These skills will necessary if the application wants to be different from other competitors.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful there will be an application that people from all over the world can use. People are able to talk about badminton with other people, watch videos to improve their skills or use the AI feature to help them out. As a result of this application, people are also able to badminton businesses to help supply them with badminton equipment. Overall the aim of the application is to help new and intermediate badminton players by providing tips by other people. AI technology is something that will improve over time and as result may help professional athletes improve their game due to them understanding certain patterns in their game.
