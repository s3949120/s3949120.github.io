								<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
								<span class="image personality"><img src="images/google.jpg" alt="Picture of google" /></span>
								<p>	Working at Google or any big tech company would be a dream of mine, as this will allow me to get paid a decent amount of money and also be flexible with the hours that I work. Having watched youtube videos of a day in the life of a software engineer the work environment seems very relaxed, which is an environment that I want to work in. Some skills, qualifications and experience required for this position are to have at least 4 years of experience in the software development field have experience working with C, C++, Java or Python. While these are the basic requirement, it is recommended to know at least two or more coding languages. Currently, I only have some experience in programming c# and a little bit of python, this is from me learning c# in high school as part of my subject. I plan to obtain these skills by having a mentor in the field to help guide me on this journey. I will also have to do a lot of self-studying at home to catch up/be on par with the people around me. I will also have to study for the interview questions which will mean I will have to use websites that will give me interview coding questions as practice.
								</p>
								<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a job that will be in demand in the future as technology develops and that means more malicious attacks will take place, it will be the job of the cyber security people to tackle the problem and build a security system that will prevent the attacks from stealing data and other important items. This job will require me to be able to identify any security vulnerabilities and then provide the appropriate recommendations to help prevent the vulnerability from happening. So far I have little to no knowledge of how to spot a security vulnerability, which means that I will need to learn the skills required in this field. By taking a course in IT, I hope I will be able to learn more about cyber security.
